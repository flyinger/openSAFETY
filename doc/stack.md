The openSAFETY stack {#stack}
============

openSAFETY is provided as a software implementation with two parts.

* **Safety Configuration Manager** (SCM) - this part provides the network managment
  as well as the configuration and parameterization managment for an openSAFETY
  domain
* **Safety Node** (SN) - this software part is used by all openSAFETY participants
  and implements the general functionality of an openSAFETY device.
  
> **Note:** For a normal implementation of an openSAFETY device, which will
> act as a simple participant on an openSAFETY network, **SN** software stack
> is all that is necessary to implement, and the directory for **SCM** can be 
> ignored completely.
